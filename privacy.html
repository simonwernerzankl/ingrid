    <br><strong>Legitimate interest</strong> - Nekst Innovation AB may process Personal Data if we have assessed that a legitimate interest overrides the interest of fundamental rights and freedoms of the Data Subject, and if the processing is necessary for the purpose in question.</p>

Depending on the lawful basis on which we support the Processing, this may a) be regulated in a contract, b) be dependent on valid consent, c) be stated in legislation or d) follow by an internal assessment based on a legitimate interest assessment (LIA).

  <h3>Your rights</h3>
  <p>You are the one in control of your Personal data and we always strive to ensure that you can exercise your rights as efficiently and smoothly as possible.
    <br>Access - You always have the right to receive information about the Processing of data that concerns you. We only provide information if we have been able to verify that it is you that are requesting the information.
    <br>Rectification - If you find that the Personal Data we process about you is incorrect, let us know and we will fix it!
    <br>Erasure - Do you want us to completely forget about you? You have the right to be forgotten and request deletion of your Personal Data when the Processing is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. If we are required to retain your information under applicable law or a contract that we have entered with you, we will ensure that it is processed only for the specific purpose set forth in such applicable law or contract. We will thereafter erase the information as soon as possible.
    <br>Objections - Do you disagree with our assessment that a legitimate interest for Processing your Personal Data overrides your interest in protecting your privacy? Donâ€™t worry - in such case, we will review our legitimate interest assessment. Of course, we add your objection to the balance and make a new assessment to see if we can still justify our Processing of your Personal Data. If you object to direct marketing, we will immediately delete your personal information without making an assessment.
    <br>Restriction - You can also ask us to restrict our Processing of your Personal Data
    <ul>
      <li>Whilst we are Processing a request from you for any of your other rights;</li>
      <li>If, instead of requesting erasure, you want us to limit the Processing of Personal Data for a specific purpose. For example, if you do not want us to send advertising to you in the future, we still need to save your name in order to know that we should not contact you; or</li>
      <li>In cases where we no longer need the information in relation to the purpose for which it was collected, provided that you do not have an interest in retaining it to make a legal claim.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>Data portability - We may provide you with the data that you have submitted to us or that we have received from you in connection with a contract that we have entered with you. You will receive your information in a commonly used and machine-readable format that you can transfer to another personal data manager.
    <br>Withdraw consent - If you have given consent to one or several specific processing(s) of your Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and thus ask us to terminate the Processing immediately. Please note that you can only withdraw your consent for future processing of Personal Data and not for Processing that has already taken place.</p>
